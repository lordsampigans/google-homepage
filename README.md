# google-homepage
This is a draw up of what the Google home page looks like. It's not intended to function on the back end, but just look good on the front end. This was done under the instruction of The Odin Project. You can find The Odin Project here : http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav.
